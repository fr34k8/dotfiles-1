dotfiles
========

My very own dotfiles :D

## Install on a new computer

```
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:kiasaki/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

That's it, that's all. You are up and running with the best config possible (for kiasaki)

## Contents

Mostly config for the following:

- Vim
- Git
- Bash shell
- tmux
